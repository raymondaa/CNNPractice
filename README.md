Modified AlexNet, Resnet18, and VGG16 for the CIFAR10 dataset and attempted to create CNN's that could rival them within 10 epochs of training.

VGG16 took lots of VRAM and quite a long time to train, over and hour and not a single epoch of training completed

Run in Google Colab with GPU Accelerator settings.
